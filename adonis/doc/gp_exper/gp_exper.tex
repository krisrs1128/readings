\title{Invalidity of ADONIS in the Presence of Between-Site Correlation}
\author{Kris Sankaran}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

On occasion, the $p$-values obtained by the permutation procedure described in
\citep{anderson2001new} (implemented as the \texttt{adonis} function in
\cite{oksanen2007vegan}) have seemed suspiciously significant, sometimes out of
line with several other analysis on the same data. We have had various
hypotheses about why the permutation procedure might not be appropriate in
microbiome data -- bacteria and sites tend to be correlated across phyla and
time, for example. In this note, we try to formalize this intuition and quantify
the robustness (or lack thereof) of the adonis permutation procedure. We believe
that a more careful understanding of this method is a relevant area of
statistical research, in light of the popularity of this method in standard
microbiome analysis practice (see e.g. \cite{fukuyama2012comparisons} and
references therein).

Our analysis is directly inspired by \citep{guillot2013dismantling}, which also
studied validity of the Mantel test, another type of distanced-based,
nonparametric hypothesis test. The main idea in both their work and ours is that
measurements across multiple sites will often express some sort of between-site
correlation structure, and that it is important to maintain this structure under
the permutation null. More precisely, the null hypothesis should only be that
the two processes are independent of one another, not that the two processes are
independent and each have no between-site correlation. But the latter structure
is what is simulated in ADONIS' permutation null, and if the processes are
actually independent but with within-process site correlation, ADONIS will still
report that there is an association between them, when there are in fact none.

We will describe some simple linear-model based alternatives to ADONIS that
provide valid $p$-values. The drawback of these approaches is that they cannot
be applied when only distances between sites is available -- a setting which is
meaningful in microbiome studies, where working entirely with UniFrac distances
\citep{lozupone2005unifrac} is common, for example.

There are two main limitations in this note,

\begin{itemize}
\item As in any simulation study, the conclusions are only as useful as the
  simulation mechanism is representative of the data encountered in practice.
  Ideally we could characterize the plausibility of our simulation mechanism,
  with respect to real data.
\item We have no alternative to ADONIS that can be applied when only distances
  are available. We could imagine more sophisticated approaches, based on
  model-free knockoffs, for example.
\end{itemize}

Hopefully these deficiencies will be resolved as this work matures.

\section{Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

In this section, we describe the our simulation design. This has two components:
how do we generate the null data, and how do we test for associations. We have
several approaches for each.

\subsection{Data generating mechanism}
\label{subsec:data_generating_mechanism}

As mentioned in the introduction, the goal of our simulation study is to
formally encode the qualitative observation that ADONIS may incorrectly report
an association between independent measurements when the measurements exhibit
between-site correlation. Suppose $X \in \reals^{n \times p}$ is a matrix of
abundances for $p$ species across $n$ sites. Let $y \in \{0, 1\}^{n}$ encode a
binary categorical measurement for each site. For example, this could represent
whether a site is arid or not, and the study might be attempting to determine
whether the species signatures across sites is related to site climate.

In our first data generating mechanism, we imagine that each species has an
abundance that varies smoothly over space. Specifically, we model the abundance
of the $j^{th}$ species over space according to a Gaussian Process (GP) with
kernel
$\kappa\left(u_{i}, u_{j}\right) = a\exp{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}\|u_{i} - u_{j}\|^{2}}$.
We think of $u \in \reals^{2}$ as the geographic location of the site.
Specifically, we suppose,
\begin{align}
  x_{j} &\sim GP\left(0, \kappa\right)
\end{align}
for $j = 1, \dots, p$. This defines $p$ random functions, one for each species,
which have high values at locations $u$ where the the species are abundant and
low values where they are not.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figure/x_gaussian}
  \caption{\label{fig:x_gaussian} The simulated $X$ matrix according to the
    first data generating mechanism. Each panel represents one species. Within a
    panel, a point gives the abundance for the associated species at one site
    and at one timepoint. The $x$-axis encodes the coordinate $u_{1}$ of the
    sites location, while the size of the points encodes $u_{2}$. The color of
    each point encodes the site characteristic $y$. The main idea is that
    species abundances vary smoothly across space and are independent of site
    characteristics.}
\end{figure}

For the site labels $y$, we first define a random process of probabilities by
passing an independent GP through a logit link,
\begin{align}
  p \vert f &\sim \frac{1}{1 + \exp{-f}} \\
  f &\sim GP\left(0, \kappa\right).
\end{align}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figure/p_gp}
  \caption{\label{fig:p_gp} To simulate the vector of site characteristics $y$,
    we pass a GP through a logit link. Each circle represents the probability
    that a given site will have $y = 1$. The $x$-axis and sizes encode $u_{1}$
    and $u_{2}$, respectively, as in Figure \ref{fig:x_gaussian}. The observed
    characteristics are marked as crosses. The idea is that the probability of
    taking on $y = 1$ varies somewhat smoothly over space.}
\end{figure}

We suppose our data set are drawn at $n$ locations $u_{1}, \dots, u_{n}$, and
that $X$ has $ij^{tth}$ entry $x_{j}\left(u_{i}\right)$ and the $i^{th}$ element
of $y$ is drawn as $y_{i} \sim \Ber\left(p\left(u_{i}\right)\right)$. If we use
different realizations of a GP for generating the $x_{j}$ and $f$, then the site
category labels $y$ and species abundances $X$ are independent of one another.
However, across sites, both $y$ and the $x_{j}$'s have strong between-site
(i.e., between-coordinate) correlation. Therefore, we have provided one
quantitative model of the null situation described in the introduction.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figure/x_poisson}
  \caption{\label{fig:x_poisson} The second data generation mechanism ensures
    that $X$ are true counts. The figure is read exactly as in figure
    \ref{fig:x_gaussian}. Again, we see the average count varies smoothly over
    space, though there tend to be larger swaths of space where all counts are
    small.}
\end{figure}

Our second data generating mechanism is a minor variant of the first, where
we ensure that the entries of $X$ are counts. To achieve this, we pass a GP
through a Poisson link. That is, the mechanism is identical to the above,
except that we take,
\begin{align}
  g &\sim GP\left(0, \kappa\right)
\end{align}
and at location $u_{i}$ we draw
$x_{j}\left(u_{i}\right) \sim \Poi\left(g\left(u_{i}\right)\right)$.

\subsection{Methods description}
\label{subsec:methods_description}

We review three approaches to measuring the strength of the association between
$X$ and $y$ -- ADONIS, logistic regression, and linear modeling -- which we
later apply in our simulation study.

\subsubsection{ADONIS}
\label{subsubsec:adonis}

ADONIS is a nonparametric alternative to ANOVA \citep{anderson2001new}. The main
idea is that the within and between sums-of-squares, which are central to ANOVA
can be represented in terms of pairwise sums-of-squares. Substituting generic
pairwise distances for these pairwise sums-of-squares leads to a nonparametric
analog of the ANOVA decomposition. The advantage of this approach is that it
allows inference based simply on pairwise distances between sites -- say,
Bray-Curtis or UniFrac distances -- which might be more sensitive to the types
of variation that are meaningful in the microbial ecology setting than ordinary
euclidean distance, which is implicitly assumed by ANOVA.

However, the nonparametric analog of the $F$-statistic is no longer
$F$-distributed, so standard theory theory does not provide valid inference.
Instead, a permutation scheme is considered. In the one-way ANOVA case, we
recompute the nonparametric $F$-statistic under many permutations of $y$ and use
the resulting histogram as the null reference distribution.

When more covariates are included, such a permutation scheme is not sufficient,
and in general it is not straightforwards to design valid permutation tests,
because the permutations must respect constraints impsed by null hypothesis
\cite{anderson2001new}. The implementation in \citep{oksanen2007vegan} is only
approximate, applying independent permutations to each covariate in the model.
Note in particular that this permutation scheme breaks the between-site
correlation in the simulated $y$.

%% \begin{align}
%%   WSS &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k = 1}^{K} \sum_{i \in S_{k}} \left(x_{i} - \bar{x}_{k}\right)^{2}
%% \end{align}

%% \begin{align}
%%   BSS &= \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k = 1}^{K} \left(\bar{x}_{k} - \bar{x}\right)^{2}
%% \end{align}


We apply ADONIS using the function \texttt{adonis} in the vegan package
\citep{oksanen2007vegan}. In our simulation, we treat the distances between
species profiles $X$ as the response and the category $y$ and locations $u$ as
covariates. The associations with categories $y$ is of core interest, while the
$u$'s are included to ``control for'' location variation\footnote{We will see
  that this does not seem to control for the (nonlinear) location variation seen
  in our simulation.}. Specifically, our calls have the form given in example
\ref{code:adonis}, where we use a euclidean distance for the ordinary GP setup
and Bray-Curtis for the Poisson setup.

\begin{code}
\begin{minted}[mathescape, linenos, frame=lines, framesep=2mm]{R}
  ## use method = 'euclidean' for gaussian process x
  adonis(x ~ y + u, method = "bray")
\end{minted}
\captionof{listing}{An example call to adonis in our simulation. Here,
  \texttt{x} is an $n \times p$ matrix of species abundances across $n$ sites,
  $y$ is a length $n$ binary indicator variable, and $u$ is an $\reals^{n \times
    2}$ matrix of site coordinates.
}
\label{code:adonis}
\end{code}

\subsection{Logisitc regression}
\label{subsec:logistic_regression}

We could instead measure the association between species counts $X$ and site
characteristics $y$ using a logistic regression. The fact that the $y$ are
binary means we can treat them as a response in a logistic regression model,
using $X$ and site locations $u$ as covariates (again, $u$ is thrown in as a
control in the association between $x$ and $y$). Note that this approach does
not apply any specialized distances between species profiles, which is one
reason ADONIS might be preferred.

We can recover $p$-values using standard theory for logistic regression. This
theory differs somewhat from our simulation setting, however, because the
ordinary theory assumes the $y_{i}$ are i.i.d, given a linear model on the
logitted probabilities. In our simulation, different coordinates of $y_{i}$ have
nonlinearly varying probabilities depending on their location.

We implement this using the \texttt{glm} command, as in \ref{code:logistic}.

\begin{code}
\begin{minted}[mathescape, linenos, frame=lines, framesep=2mm]{R}
  glm(y ~ x + u, family = binomial())
\end{minted}
\captionof{listing}{An example call for applying logistic regression of species
  counts onto site characteristisc.}
\label{code:logistic}
\end{code}

\subsection{Linear regression}
\label{subsec:linear_regression}

Alternatively, we could flip the species counts and the site characteristics in
our regression. Unlike ADONIS, we can only have one species at a time in our
response variable. In our simulation, we will only consider a model applied to
our first species. In the GP data-generating mechanism, we will use a standard
linear regression, while for the Poisson-GP data-generating mechanism, we will
use a poisson regression.

We will the $p$-value for the coefficient of $y$ provided by the standard
regression theory. Note that, as in the logistic regression, the errors
$\eps_{i}$ are actually correlated in our model, so the theory is in fact
violated. We will see what effect this has on the validity of our test during
our simulation study. Code for this procedure is provided in
\ref{code:linear_reg}.

\begin{code}
\begin{minted}[mathescape, linenos, frame=lines, framesep=2mm]{R}
  glm(x[, 1] ~ y + u, family = "poisson")
\end{minted}
\captionof{listing}{An example call for applying Poisson regression of site
  characteristics onto counts for the first species.}
\label{code:linear_reg}
\end{code}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We simulate 1000 replicates of the setup described in section \ref{sec:setup},
for each data generating mechanism and method. The resulting $p$-values are
described in figure \ref{fig:pvals_comparison}. 

More precisely, the ADONIS $p$-value is the permutation $p$-value for the $y$
coefficient and the (Poisson) linear model $p$-values those for the coefficient
of the $y$ covariate. In contrast, the $p$-values for the logistic regression
are those for the coefficients for each species -- this is why there are so many
more $p$-values in the logistic regression row of figure
\ref{fig:pvals_comparison}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figure/pvals_comparison}
  \caption{\label{fig:pvals_comparison} A comparison of the null $p$-values
    according to the different data-generating mechanisms and methods. Different
    methods are arranged across rows, while the GP and Poisson-GP data
    generating mechanisms are in the left and right columns, respectively.
    Ideally, these would all look approximately uniform, and the fact that they
    are not means these tests are not valid. Further, the $p$-values for ADONIS
    seem particularly far from uniform.
  }
\end{figure}

Evidently, the $p$-values associated with all procedures are not quite uniform.
In light of our earlier discussion, this is not surprising. Both the logistic
and linear regression models fail because the errors are correlated, since the
location $u$ has a nonlinear influence on both $x$ and $y$. The ADONIS
permutation procedure also fails to account for the influence of the $u$s, since
it breaks the correlation between sites. However, those provided by ADONIS are
strongly concentrated on very low values. Indeed, the permutation procedure in
this setting seems poorly suited in the case of correlated sites, even when they
are included as covariates in the regression.
