\section{Introduction}

Vannevar Bush anticipated information retrieval problems: ``Our ineptitude in
getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of
indexing.'' Probabilsitic models give one way of associating similar documents
with one another. Main novel methods are LDA, a Dirichlet Process version, and a
nested / hierarchical LDA.
